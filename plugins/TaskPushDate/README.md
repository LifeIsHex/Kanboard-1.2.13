Automatic action: Push due date when moving cards
=================================================

This plugin allows you to create an automatic action in Kanboard that will push the due date of a card
out a user specified number of days when moved to a user specified column.

The goal is to make updating due dates easier during a drag and drop operation.

When adding an automatic action, the action name is shown as
"Automatically set the task due date when the task is moved to another column"
